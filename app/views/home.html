      Track-It provides a service to manage multiple projects in connection to Malm√∂ University. These projects are both bachelor's and master's theses, as well as course related projects. External customers can upload proposals for projects that students can apply for. These proposals are then reviewed and, if approved, categorized. Then students can form groups and apply to the proposals they are interested in working on. When a group of students have been assigned to a proposal, by a teacher, it goes from being a proposal to an active project.
