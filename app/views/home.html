        TrackIt provides a simple service to manage projects in connection with Malm√∂ University. These can be both bachelor's and master's theses, as well as course related projects. External customers can create and upload project proposals. These are then reviewed, categorized, and approved by teachers. Students can form teams and apply to approved proposals they are interested in working on. A teacher can then assign a team to a proposal, at which point it becomes an active project.
